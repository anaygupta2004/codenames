Has every team member contributed at least once to the discussion? If not, there is no consensus yet.\n    2. Is there a word that multiple team members have suggested with Medium or Low risk? This indicates emerging consensus.\n    3. Calculate confidence scores for each candidate word based on frequency and risk assessments.\n    4. If confidence for a word is above 75%, consensus is likely reached.\n    \n    Your task is to EITHER:\n    \n    A.

If no consensus yet, return a \"no_consensus\" word, explain what's missing, and suggest what needs to be discussed next\n    \n    For a valid consensus, you MUST have:\n    - Multiple team members supporting the same word\n    - Clear reasoning why the word connects to the clue\n    - Risk assessment that all participants acknowledge\n    \n    {{ ctx.output_format }}\n    \n    {{ _.role(\"user\") }} Based on this discussion, has consensus been reached?
